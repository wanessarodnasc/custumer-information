# Getting Started

The following was discovered as part of building this project:

* The original package name 'com.nubank.custumer-information' is invalid and this project uses 'com.nubank.custumerinformation' instead.

To execute this application run the CustumerInformationApplication class, this class will start the application and execute in the 8080 port. 
To became easier starting using the application on the data.sql file we have few initial registers.
